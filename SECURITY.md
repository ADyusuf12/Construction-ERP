# Security Policy

The Hamzis Systems team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us by reporting it privately. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please send an email to **[INSERT SECURITY CONTACT EMAIL, e.g., security@your-domain.com]**.

Please include the following details with your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The version or commit hash of the code where the vulnerability exists.
- Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggested mitigation for the vulnerability.

We will do our best to respond to your report within 48 hours. Once the vulnerability has been patched, we will credit you for the discovery unless you wish to remain anonymous.

## Supported Versions

As the project evolves, we will provide security updates for specific versions. Please refer to the table below for currently supported versions.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `0.1.x` | :white_check_mark: |
| ...     | ...                |

We encourage all users to run the latest stable version of the application to ensure they have the most recent security patches.

## Security Best Practices

While we strive to make the application as secure as possible, we also recommend following these best practices in your own deployments:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update gems and other dependencies to their latest versions.
- **Secure Your Environment:** Follow security best practices for your servers, databases, and other infrastructure.
- **Use Strong Passwords and Secrets:** Never commit sensitive information like database passwords or secret keys to your repository. Use Rails credentials or environment variables.

Thank you for helping keep Hamzis Systems secure.
